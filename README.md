## Game Logic

### Overview

In Pixel Coder, players embark on a quest to help the protagonist, David, prepare for a full-stack development interview. The game unfolds as a series of coding challenges that players must solve to progress through the story.

### Player Decisions

- **Question Types**: Players are presented with coding-related questions that range from HTML and CSS to JavaScript.
- **Answer Choices**: Each question offers multiple-choice answers, and players must select the option they believe is correct.
- **Code Challenges**: Some questions may involve debugging code snippets or completing lines of code.

### Game Mechanics

- **Progression**: For every three consecutive correct answers, David's professional attire improves, reflecting his growing readiness for the interview.
- **Non-Penalization**: Incorrect answers do not penalize the player but halt David's progress in dressing up for success.
- **Assistance**: The game includes hints and study resources that players can use to assist with tougher questions.

### Victory/Progress Evaluation

- **Victory Condition**: The player's victory is determined by successfully completing all challenges and fully preparing David for his interview.
- **Progress Tracking**: Progress is tracked by the number of correct answers and the visual transformation of David's attire.
- **Conclusion**: The game concludes with a simulated interview scene where David's preparation is put to the test.

## Post-MVP Plans

- **Hint System**: Implement a "Hint System" that provides coding tips or partial solutions to challenging questions.
- **Code Editor Mode**: Introduce a "Code Editor" mode where players can write and run code to solve problems, simulating a real coding environment.
- **Career Path Feature**: Add a "Career Path" feature that unlocks different coding languages and technologies based on the player's choices and achievements, offering a tailored learning experience.
