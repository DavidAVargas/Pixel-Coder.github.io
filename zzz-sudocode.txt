Some ToDos:
- Study semantic HTML (done)
- FIll out your questions objects with some real questions you want to ask in all three categories (done)
- Write out the narrative for the game that you display at the beginning. ? confused
- If you want to have some fun with CSS, chose a "color platte" and "fun font pairs." Google those two and you'll find some cool tools.
- Research types of question/answer interfaces and see if you want to use multiple choice, radial buttons, or something else.(done)
- Do you want to use sounds? Maybe research some sounds you want to use and download them as mp3s. ANy other fun assets, when you have time and are too tired to think, you can do these sorts of tasks.(done)
- Create a start game button that has an event listener attached that fires off a function called "game". TO start, the function can just console log "game started." See the rock paper scissors game or the DOM manipulation code we wrote two sessions ago for examples, or look up event handlers and try it out!(done)


- Look up how to create a card-flip effect with CSS
Add to the list of things you want to explore!



maybe use canvas for the game?
